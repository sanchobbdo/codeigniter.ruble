# Give Code Igniter some Aptana love

This is a work on progress and input (be it suggestions, code or requests) is highly appreciated. If you're a Ruby ninja who happens to like Code Igniter please take a look at the scripts since I'm not a Ruby expert.

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/camagu/codeigniter.ruble/issues) to make you're suggestions and requests.

## Purpose

Make the CI and Aptana duet as productive as it could be!

Issues we should address:

- Intelisense (code suggestions)
- Apply CI's coding standards in our code
- Quick easy to use templates

## Current features

- CI_Model and CI_Controller snippets (`ci_model`, `ci_controller`)
- Code Igniter template for **Web projects**
- Command to update the CI template

## History

Started out as a fork of [SidKumarSingh / CodeIgniter-Bundle-for-Aptana](https://github.com/SidKumarSingh/CodeIgniter-Bundle-for-Aptana) but I was doing so much changes I decided to start from scratch.
